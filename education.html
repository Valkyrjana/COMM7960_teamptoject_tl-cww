              AI has the potential to transform education by enabling personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, adaptive assessment, content creation 
              and administrative tasks. Generally, AI-powered tools can help educators gain more specific knowledge about students, 
              and help them do better in their interesting field.
              By leveraging AI in education, we can create a more engaging, effective, and inclusive learning environment.</em>

              <strong style="color:white; font-size: 22px;">Personalized Learning: </strong><br>
              AI can analyze the learning patterns 
              and preferences of individual students and provide them with personalized learning experiences. 
              It can recommend specific courses, materials, and activities tailored to their needs and abilities.<br>
              In our example, the AI Learning Helper from NTT DATA Business Solutions supports children to become confident readers. 
              The teaching engine helps pupils with vocabularies, pronunciation, and understanding stories. 
              The digital avatar can ask and answer questions and detect emotions.

            <li class="p">
              <strong style="color:white;font-size: 22px;">Content Creation: </strong><br>AI can generate educational content, such as quizzes, assignments, and lesson plans, based on specific learning objectives and student needs. This can save teachers time and effort and ensure that the content is tailored to the needs of individual students.
            </li><br>
            <li class="p">
              <strong style="color:white;font-size: 22px;">Administrative Tasks: </strong><br>AI can automate administrative tasks, such as grading and attendance tracking, freeing up teachers' time to focus on teaching and interacting with students.
